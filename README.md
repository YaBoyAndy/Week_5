# Week_5
As you suggested I started earlier on this project. Everything was fine until I tried to run the final .py file. I feel asleep at my computer last night trying to figure out why it wouldnâ€™t run. I woke up this morning at my desk and decided to submit the code unfinished. Right before I submitted the code I decided to try to pull the data for the .py from a .csv instead of the .xlsx that I have been using and for whatever reason that fixed everything.
